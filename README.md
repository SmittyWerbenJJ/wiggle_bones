# Wiggle Bones for Blender

Wiggle bones is a fork by of jiggle bone.
This repository was initially created to assist the fork author to put his work under version control. ([thread](https://blenderartists.org/t/wiggle-bones-a-jiggle-bone-implementation-for-2-8/1154726/682))

I plan to also fork my own version in a dedicated branch, releases from that branch will be marked distincly.

## Install

- Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/mtb-tools/wiggle_bones/releases)
- In Blender go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install (button on the top right), and select the archive.
